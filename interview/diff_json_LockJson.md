## Difference between package.json and package-lock.json

## 1.Purpose:

# package.json: 
This file is primarily used for managing and documenting metadata about the project, including its name, version, author, dependencies, scripts, and other configuration details. It acts as a manifest for the project.

# package-lock.json: 
This file is generated and updated automatically by npm when installing or updating packages. It is used to lock the exact versions of dependencies installed in the project, ensuring reproducibility and consistent installations across different environments.

## 2.Dependency Specification:

# package.json: 
It contains the list of dependencies required for the project, along with their desired version ranges specified using semantic versioning or specific version numbers.

# package-lock.json: 
It includes the specific resolved versions of all the dependencies, their sub-dependencies, and their exact installation locations. It acts as a snapshot of the dependency tree for ensuring consistent installations.


### summary
 the package.json file focuses on project metadata and specifying the desired versions of dependencies, while the package-lock.json file ensures deterministic installations by locking the exact versions of dependencies and their dependencies. Both files are essential for managing dependencies, but they serve different purposes in the Node.js development workflow.
