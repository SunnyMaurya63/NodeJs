Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform and JavaScript runtime environment. 

“Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

It enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, 
and runs scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user’s web browser.

 Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

 Node.js’ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
 **  npm (Node package manager) has packages you can use in your apps to make your development faster and efficient.
